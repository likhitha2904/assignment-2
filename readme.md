# CampusPe Python Assignment 2

## Student Information
- Full Name: Likhitha MM
- Course: GenAI
- College: The National Institute of Engineering, Mysuru.

## Assignment Overview
- This repository contains solutions to Questions 1-20.
- Each question has been implemented according to the problem statement, including required functionality and I've tried to attempt some bonus sections whereever applicable.
- I've applied try-except almost in every program.
- I've attempted to code and have run all of the programs with all possible input cases.
- Each file corresponds to one question from the assignment.

## Challenges Faced

- Designing modular menu-driven systems.
- Handling edge cases, using try-except, ensuring proper exception handling across all programs.(negative numbers, zero, invalid inputs).
- Implementing efficient prime number checking, different string operations.
- Structuring text analysis functions correctly.

## Testing

Each file has been tested with:
- Valid inputs
- Invalid inputs
- Boundary cases
- Multiple runs to verify correctness
